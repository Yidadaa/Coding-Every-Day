# Addition Information for GSoC JdeRobot Application

This docment is written to answer the questions listed at ["Send us your information"](https://jderobot.github.io/activities/gsoc/2020#send-us-your-information).

## 1. Contact Details
You can find my contact information in my [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EdUZmT0cmlmpsL83ujNscz6ShZ5Kx3kc/view?usp=sharing).

## 2. Timeline
So far, I don't know the detail of the **Project #8: Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving with Gazebo and OpenAI gym**, so I can only give a rough timeline.

I definitely understand that GSoC is a full-time summer internship, and I am ready to work for it during my summer holiday. Until now, there are no known time conflicts, and if there were any accident events during the period, I will inform my mentor in advance.

**Timeline:**   
1. May 5, 2020 - June 2 2020: Get familiar with mentor, code, workflow and all other things about JdeRobot, we will determine what algorithms to implement and every detail of the project.
2. June 2 2020 - July 1 2020: System Design, a simple demo should be finished to verify our ideas.
3. July 1 2020 - August 1 2020: Algorithm Implementation, including algorithm and a series tests for it. A benchmark report should be finished at the end of this period.
4. August 1 2020 - August 25 2020: Documentation and Code Review, a pull request should be made in this period.

## 3. Studies
I am very interested in Robotics, and my graduation thesis is about how to accelerate the training of reinforcement learning in Unity, so I think this GSoC project will be a strong supplement for that.

## 4. Programming Background
My major is computer science, so I have a strong programming background, as you can see from my resume, I have accumulated rich experience in programming.

I am very familiar with Python / Javascript / C++ and have written many projects with them.

Beyond that, I have completed the lessons of Computer Vision and Machine Learning / Deep Learning in my period of graduate study, you can find relevant projects in my github.

## 5. GSoC Participation
I haven't participated to any GSoC project before, and I hope we will have a nice coding time during GSoC 2020.
